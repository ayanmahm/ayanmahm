# Hi, I'm Ayan Mahmood.
This is my GitHub profile, where I will be storing both private projects, and showcasing some of the work that I've completed in the past.

* In 2022, I completed a project as part of my studies, where I designed and developed an application to help students look for work placements that suited their choice in degree. Unlike other options, I tried to develop from the standpoint of a school, and implemented features that teachers and students could use to share specific courses, and monitor grade progress over time.
*  In 2021, I created a small program in Python to take data from the internet, and compose some views of that data.

*  This repository also contains some work from my modules at university, done in Java and soon some additions in C++
